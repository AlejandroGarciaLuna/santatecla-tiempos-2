## Phase 1

#### In fase 1 we've built the base structure for our web page, divided into 4 sections: Categories, events, time and intervals, plus a login button. Every section has been edited as indicated in requirements using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Dashboard. 

##### Default Page

## Phase2

#### In phase 2, the one created in phase 1 for the implementation of Mustache has been used as the base model so that the page goes from being static to dynamic. To achieve this, we have also used Spring and Maven frameworks based on Java, as well as the use of a database in sql language for the storage, creation and deletion of data.

##### Configuration of the development environment
Eclipse as Intellij so we will explain how to configure them for both of them. The environment configuration for Eclipse can be done in two ways:
- If you have downloaded the Eclipse STS, it already comes with the framework of Spring boot therefore we just have to create a project   in the what we say the dependencies that we want as the base of data or the devTools.
- If you have a normal Eclipse it would be enough to go to the section of market that has Eclipse and look for the FrameWork of Spring Boot, the will be installed automatically once selected and the form to create a project is in the same way as the previous one with the only difference that you will have to choose the type of project manually.

In Intellij Idea you can only program with this framework in the business version. The installation of Spring Boot is made from the beginning of the application. Once this is done, it will be enough to do a project from scratch with all the necessary dependencies.
